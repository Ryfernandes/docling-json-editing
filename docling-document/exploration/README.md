# Exploration

The files in this directory are what I used to jot down notes and test ideas while exploring Docling Documents. The cells in the notebook may not run smoothly, as I constantly jumped around/replaced/removed cells. For better summarized notes and example notebooks, go to the enclosing directory (docling-document).
